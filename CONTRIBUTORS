LiteX ecosystem would not exist without the collaborative work of contributors! Here is below the
list of all the LiteSPI contributors.

In the source code, each file list the main authors/contributors:
- author(s) that created the initial content.
- contributor(s) that added essential features/improvements.

If you think you should be in this list and don't find yourself, write to florent@enjoy-digital.fr
and we'll fix it!
